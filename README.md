# reactjsHelloWorld
Practicing reactjs
This is build with the help of "The Net Ninja" Reactjs tutorial from youtube

Create package.json with "npm init"

Here i have npm installed
1. react
2. react-dom
3. babel-core
4. babel-preset-es2015
5. babel-loader
6. babel-loader-react
7. webpack
8. webpack-dev-server

Please do npm install after downloading this tutorial.

After installing all this npm files, then created a webpack.config.js, which is the copy paste from the youtube tutorial link.

Then edited the scripts portion of package.json, added the start and build, so that using webpack is easy.

Added a index.js file and just typed an alert.

In the index.html file just added the output "bundle.js" created by webpack.
